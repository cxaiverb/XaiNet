I made this out of spite towards the default Windows networking taskbar item.
Also Defender is currently upset with me, I have sent it in to be reviewed by Microsoft


This program adds a new taskbar item.

On right click, it gives you 3 options and exit. Option 1 openes the control panels network/adapter options, option 2 opens the windows settings app for network, and option 3 shows all of your adapters basic info.

There is also a UI that appears when clicking the icon, and this is where most future updates will be. Its current state looks like this:

I plan on adding OpenVPN config support so that you can enable and disable it in the toolbar with ease, graphs for network usage, and just overall making it look better.
I still need to add wifi searching/discovery, that will come in a future update

This is heavily inspired by the Network Manager that comes with KDE.
