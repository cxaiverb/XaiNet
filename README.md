I made this out of spite towards the default Windows networking taskbar item.


This program adds a new taskbar item.

On right click, it gives you 3 options and exit. Option 1 openes the control panels network/adapter options, option 2 opens the windows settings app for network, and option 3 shows all of your adapters basic info.

There is also a UI that appears when clicking the icon, and this is where most future updates will be. Its current state looks like this:

I plan on adding OpenVPN config support so that you can enable and disable it in the toolbar with ease, graphs for network usage, and just overall making it look better.

This is heavily inspired by the Network Manager that comes with KDE.
